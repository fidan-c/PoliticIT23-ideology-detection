# TÃ¼bingen at PoliticIT: Exploring SVMs, Pretrained Language Models, and Linguistic Transfer for Ideology Detection in Social Media

Much like other personal characteristics, such as gender, age, or native language, political ideology represents a useful psychographic trait that can help to understand individual and social behavior.

This repository hosts the data and the solutions we submitted for the [EVALITA 2023 Task - PoliticIT: Political ideology detection in Italian texts](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/8507). The goal of the task is to extract gender and political ideology from a set of Italian tweets. In this setting political ideology is considered both as a binary as well as a multiclass feature. 

In our solutions we experiment both with transformer-based models as well as traditional SVM classifiers and this is reflected in the way the present repository is organized.
